Fork of rfxn/advanced-policy-firewall to support systemd. This A readme specific to changes made for this fork. 

1. Auto Updates
2. Installation: Boot Loading
3. Uninstall

Auto Updates)
The install script downloads the current version of apf-systemd (works on none systemd distributions aswell) to /root/apf-current-systemd.tar.gz 
(unless already downloaded to this location.) This file needs to remain in place for auto updates to work. 

Checks for updates are scheduled for once a week and Apf-SystemD is updated if an update is avaiable. 
For manual updates/check issue: /usr/local/sbin/auto-update.sh 

Auto updating is not supported with a custom install, so if using a custom install path you should disable this feature 
(systemd: systemctl disable update-apf.timer, systemctl stop update-apf.timer & systemctl disable update-apf.service or SystemV:
rm -f /etc/cron.weekly/apf). Manual check INSTALL_PATH=/etc/yourpath /usr/local/sbin/auto-update.sh

Installation: Boot Loading)
On installation APF will install a Systemd unit file or an init script to /etc/init.d/apf
or systemd unit file depending on what your distro supports, both are configured to load on boot. If you are setting up APF in a more
custom situation then you may follow the below instructions.

The modes of operation for having APF firewall your system
and each has no real benefit except tailoring itself to your needs.

This version now includes a systemd startup unit file and apf  will be automatically configured if your distrobution supports. 

The next option to setup APF in the init system with chkconfig (done by
default during install, if your disto supports SystemV init); as detailed below:

chkconfig --add apf
chkconfig --level 345 apf on

Secondly, you can add the following string too the bottom of the
/etc/rc.local file:

sh -c "/etc/apf/apf -s" &

It is NOT recommended that you use both of these startup methods together,
for most systems the init script via chkconfig should be fine.

The third is to simply run APF in an on-demand fashion. That
is, enable it with the 'apf -s' command when desired and disable it with the
'apf -f' when desired.

3. Uninstall)
Also comes with an uninstall script: /usr/local/sbin/apf-uninstall.sh
Uninstall custom install path: INSTALL_PATH=/etc/yourpath /usr/local/sbin/apf-uninstall.sh
